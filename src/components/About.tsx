        <p className="mb-4">
          With over a decade of experience as a full-stack developer, I've led project teams at tech startups across Vietnam, Thailand, Japan, and Singapore. I've also worked as a freelance engineer for companies in Asia Pacific, Europe, and North America.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Currently, I'm a Senior Full Stack Software Engineer at ACX, where I continue to explore and learn about emerging and popular technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          My passion lies in learning in public and contributing to open-source projects, which allows me to share knowledge and collaborate with the global developer community.
